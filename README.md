# Android client-server game development

// Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
     
     The Gaming Room was a client that had a working Android game that they wanted to transition into a web-based game in order to allow
     more platforms to access it. They wanted to have a client-server based application that had one server acccessed by multiple
     applications, keeping track of multiple games, teams, and players at once.
     
// What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
     
     I believe the part that I did the best was with creating the software design document that was used to create the project.
     
// What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
     
     When working on the software design document, I found it easier to develop the code for the project, since I had already documented
     the modules, and functions that I needed in order to write the code. The design document worked as a blueprint for creating the code.
     
// If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
     
     I would probably redesign my code itself. I didn't create the code precisely to the design document, and left out a couple of items
     that were needed.
     
// How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
     
     When I was writing the design document, I interpreted the user's needs to specific parts of the code. I knew what the client wanted
     to accomplish with their software, and created code that accomplished that, with security features built in. A programmer needs to
     consider the user's needs when designing code, because what the designer wants may not neccessarily be what the client wants.
     Also, the designer needs to interpret what the client wants, and add in any code needed that wasn't listed, such as adding security
     features that the client may not have thought of.
     
//How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
     I take a look at the software design document, decide what functions are needed, and design the software based on the functions.
     I use the functions needed to design any class structure or to decide which modules need to be imported to make the program work.
